- Data preparation involves:
  + Process duplicate data
  + Correct wrong or inaccurate data
  + Identify missing data
  + Identify outliers
  + Identify inconsistent data
  
## Model
- Determine how tables are related to each other
- Define and create relationships between table
- Model has a **direct effect on the PERFORMANCE**
- Is an iterative process

## Visualize
- Translate information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. 
Note: - keep data small -> too much data can make detecting key point difficult

## Analyse
- Understand and interpret the info that is displayed on the report
- Use the analytical capabilities of PowerBI to find insights, identify patterns and trends, predict outcomes, and then communicate those insights in a way that everyone understand.
