# I. Overview of data analysis

Data analysis is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover meaningful and useful information. The data is then crafted into a story through reports for analysis to support the critical decision-making process.

To analyze data, core components of analytics are divided into the following categories:

### Descriptive Analytics
- `Answer the question`: What happenned?
- 90% of organizations use descriptive analytics
- Analyses the data coming in real-time and historical data for insights.
- Input: real-time and historical data
- Output: visualizations

### Diagnostic Analytics
- `Answer the question`: Why did it happen?
- Steps to do:
a) Identify anomalies in the data
b) Collect data related to these anomalies
c) Use technologies to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.
- Techniques to use: scatter charts, corrrelations, etc


### Predictive Analytics
- `Answer the question`: What will happen in the future?
- Steps to do:
  1. Define the goal
  2. Prepare the data
  3. Find insights and visualize
  4. Deploy machine learning 
  5. Itterate
- Techniques to use: statistical and machine learning techniques as K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, neural networks and regression.

### Prescriptive Analytics
- `Answer the question`: What do I need to do?
- Description: Recommend an action based on the forecast.

### Cognitive Analytics
- `Answer the question`: What might happen if circumstances change and determine how you might handle these situations?

# II. Roles in Data
## Business Analyst
- Closer to the **business**
- Is a specialist in **interpreting the data** that comes from visualization
- Tools: Word, Excel, Power Point/MS Project

## Data Analyst
- Implement the **advanced analytics capabilities into reports and visualizations**
- Profile, clean, and transform data
- Design & build scalable & effective data models
- Manage Power BI assets (reports, dashboards, workspace, and the underlying datasets, etc)
- Work with Data Engineer and DB Admin
Note: Data Analyst and Business Analyst could be the single person

## Data Engineer
- Set up data platform technologies (on-premises, in the cloud)
- Manage and secure the flow of structured and unstructured data from multiples sources
- Data can include relational db, non relational db, data streams, and file stores
- Work with business stakeholder to identify & meet data requirements, and then design & implement solutions.

## Data Scientist

## DB Admin
- DB Admin manages the overall health of a db and the hardware that it resides on, manages the user access to the data.
- Database (Microsoft Azure Services, MS SQL)

# III. Tasks of Data Analyst

## Prepare data
- Data preparation is the process of profiling, cleaning, and transforming raw data into enriched, trusted, and understandable data to get it ready to model and visualize.
- Data preparation involves:
  + Process duplicate data
  + Correct wrong or inaccurate data
  + Identify missing data
  + Identify outliers
  + Identify inconsistent data
  
## Model
- Determine how tables are related to each other
- Define and create relationships between table
- Model has a **direct effect on the PERFORMANCE**
- Is an iterative process

## Visualize
- Translate information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. 
Note: - keep data small -> too much data can make detecting key point difficult

## Analyse
- Understand and interpret the info that is displayed on the report
- Use the analytical capabilities of PowerBI to find insights, identify patterns and trends, predict outcomes, and then communicate those insights in a way that everyone understand.

## Manage
- Data assets (reports, dashboards, workspace, dataset, etc)
- Grant right data assets to right peope
- Management of PowerBI assets reduce the duplication of efforts and ensure security of the data.
- Database (Microsoft Azure Services, MS SQL)
