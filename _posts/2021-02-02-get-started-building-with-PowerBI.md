# I. Introduction of Power BI
- Is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.

# III. The flow of work in Power BI
Here is a common workflow of Power BI:
- User creates a report in **Power BI Desktop**
- He/she then publishes the report to **Power BI Service** and then shares it to others
- Users then view/interact the report/dashboard in the service and **Power BI Mobile apps**

# IV. Building Blocks in Power BI
- **Visualizations** is a visual representation of data, like a chart, a map, etc, sometimes just called visuals.
- **Dataset** is a collection of data that Power BI uses to create its visualizations.
- **Reports** is a collection of visuals from a dataset, spanning one or more pages.
- **Dashboard** is a single-page collection of visuals built from a report.
- **Tiles** is a single visualization on a report or dashbord. It is a rectangular box that holds an individual visual.

### Difference between Visualizations and Tiles:
The difference is in the origin of the Power BI artifact and the setup required to retrieve it.
- Report visual - as the name suggests, this is a visual that resides inside a Power BI report.
- Tile - this is a dashboard tile, that is essentially a visual that is pinned to a dashboard in Power BI.

### Difference between Dashboards and Reports:
